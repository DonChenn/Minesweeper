# Minesweeper AI

## Minesweeper AI Agent

This project implements an AI agent capable of solving Minesweeper boards across varying levels of difficulty.

This repository contains an implementation of a Minesweeper AI (MyAI) designed to efficiently and intelligently solve Minesweeper puzzles. The AI interacts with the Minesweeper environment by analyzing the board state and making calculated decisions to uncover cells, flag bombs, or leave the game when it believes the board is unsolvable or complete.
